The data from uart is sent as a char instead of a decimal, which doesnt affect our ability to transmit, but will intefere when we try to log to voltage
at the same time as sending command - need to reqrite the DKB code so that it send it decimals as decimals and not chars (mult_nus_send func will need
to change)

Another issue is that the FB freezes after a certain number of transmissions. I might not be handling the buffer proeperly, so once the dataa is handled
the buffer needs to be freed, and a non blocking method should be used for such processes
